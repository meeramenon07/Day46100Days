This is day 46 python code on Replit from the 100 days of python coding on Replit,
This project is about using 2D Dictionaries in Python3 to create/build  A MokeDex MokeBeast Game in Python.

This project is based on the day 46 coding challenge by Professor David .Thanks to David for his 100 days of coding challenge excercises on Replit

Today, you're going to program a full on Mok√©beast Mok√©dex. Yep, think we're getting away with it so far...



Your Mok√©dex should:

Store multiple Mok√©beasts using a loop.
Get user input of the beasts' details.
Add the details to a 2D dictionary.
Repeat until the user wants to stop.
Output the full Mok√©dex using a prettyPrint() function.
