## Key Error

ðŸ‘‰ Why am I getting the 'key error'... error?


```python
john = {"daysCompleted": 46, "streak": 22}
janet = {"daysCompleted": 21, "streak": 21}
erica = {"daysCompleted": 75, "streak": 6}

courseProgress = {"John":john, "Janet":janet, "Erica":erica}

print(courseProgress["Erica"]["daysComplete"])
```

I had tried to reference 'daysComplete' on the last line. This key doesn't exist. It's called 'daysCompleted' in the code.

```python
john = {"daysCompleted": 46, "streak": 22}
janet = {"daysCompleted": 21, "streak": 21}
erica = {"daysCompleted": 75, "streak": 6}

courseProgress = {"John":john, "Janet":janet, "Erica":erica}

print(courseProgress["Erica"]["daysCompleted"])
```
