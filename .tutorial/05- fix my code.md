janet = {"daysCompleted": 21, "streak": 21}
erica = {"daysCompleted": 75, "streak": 6}

courseProgress = {"John":john, "Janet":janet, "Erica":erica}

print(courseProgress["Janet"]["Streak"])
```

- This was subtle (on purpose). 'Erica' and 'streak' are incorrect in the `print` statement.
```python
john = {"daysCompleted": 46, "streak": 22}
janet = {"daysCompleted": 21, "streak": 21}
erica = {"daysCompleted": 75, "streak": 6}

courseProgress = {"John":john, "Janet":janet, "Erica":erica}

print(courseProgress["Erica"]["daysCompleted"])
print(courseProgress["Janet"]["streak"])
```
